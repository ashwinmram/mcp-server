  "Laravel packages that push data to remote APIs should not include database models or interact with local databases. The package should push to remote endpoints via HTTP API, and the remote server handles all database operations, validation, and model management. This separation ensures the package remains a lightweight client library.",
  "When creating Laravel packages that normalize non-uniform file formats, include normalization logic directly in package commands rather than requiring users to pre-process files. Extract categories and tags from filenames (e.g., AI_testing_config.json → category: testing-config) and from content keywords to provide rich metadata automatically.",
  "Package documentation should clearly explain architectural decisions, especially when components are intentionally excluded. For example, if a package pushes to remote APIs and doesn't include model classes, document this as a design decision to prevent confusion and clarify that database operations happen on the remote server.",
  "When extracting code from local Laravel projects into reusable packages, ensure the package version includes all necessary normalization and transformation logic. Local commands that use services (like LessonImportService with local database) should be converted to package commands that use HTTP API clients (like LessonPusherService) instead.",
  "When preparing a Laravel package for Packagist publication, create a separate git repository in the package directory (not the parent monorepo). Initialize git with `git init`, commit all package files, create an initial version tag (e.g., v1.0.0), and push to GitHub. This ensures the package can be independently versioned and distributed.",
  "Package composer.json for Packagist should include: proper name (vendor/package), description, keywords array, license, authors with name and email, and set minimum-stability to 'stable' (not 'dev'). Remove any version field from composer.json as Composer will parse versions from git tags automatically.",
  "For Packagist auto-updates via GitHub webhook, configure the webhook URL as: https://packagist.org/api/github?username=PACKAGIST_USERNAME. The webhook secret must be your Packagist API token (found on your Packagist profile page). Set content type to 'application/json' and events to 'push'. This ensures Packagist updates immediately when you push new tags.",
  "When bumping package versions, create annotated tags with `git tag -a v1.0.1 -m 'Release v1.0.1'` and push with `git push origin v1.0.1`. Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Packagist will automatically detect new tags and make them available for installation via Composer.",
  "Before publishing to Packagist, update the main project's composer.json to remove the local path repository and change the package requirement from '@dev' to a version constraint like '^1.0'. This ensures the project uses the published package version instead of the local development version."
